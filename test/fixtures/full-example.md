## Prefixes

## Locators
We can append a locator to a citation by using a hashtag:
[@Pluto-2015#p. 3] 


## Combining locators and prefixes
These features can be combined:
[@R-manual-2018#ch.3{c.f.}]. 
We can even use different modes, such
as suppressing the author: [-@R-manual-2018#ch.3{c.f.}]. 

## Multiple references in a single citation
It is possible to reference multiple sources in a single
citation, by using a semicolon (`;`): 
[@Holleis-Wagner-Koolwaaij-2010; @Shapiro-2018].

## Modes, prefixes and multiple references
We can use a mode while referring to multiple sources,by
adding a mark before the first reference and we can use
a prefix per reference:
[~@Shapiro-2018{c.f.}; @Tang-1996{different:}#p. 3].
